# Cloud-native geospatial Sentinel-2 grid

An update of [scottyhq/mgrs](https://github.com/scottyhq/mgrs) to convert the 
[Sentinel-2 grid](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/data-products) 
from KML to the cloud-native file format [GeoParquet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet). 
Two versions are available in this repository:
- `sentinel-2-grid.parquet` - the full grid
- `sentinel-2-grid_LAND.parquet` - only tiles that intersect with land areas based on the high resolution land mask by [Natural Earth]("https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/v5.1.2/geojson/ne_10m_land.geojson")

## Access examples

The GeoParquet files can be accessed directly from this repository without having to download the files.
Here are some examples to get you started:

### GeoPandas

```python
import geopandas as gpd

gdf = gpd.read_file("https://github.com/maawoo/sentinel-2-grid-geoparquet/raw/main/sentinel-2-grid.parquet", engine="pyogrio")
```

### GDAL / OGR

#### Extract individual tile and save as GeoJSON

```bash
ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" 32TNT.geojson /vsicurl/https://github.com/maawoo/sentinel-2-grid-geoparquet/raw/main/sentinel-2-grid.parquet -sql "SELECT * FROM \"sentinel-2-grid\" WHERE tile = '32TNT'"
```

#### Print file info

```bash
ogrinfo -al -so /vsicurl/https://github.com/maawoo/sentinel-2-grid-geoparquet/raw/main/sentinel-2-grid.parquet
```
This should print the metadata of the file:

```
INFO: Open of `/vsicurl/https://github.com/maawoo/sentinel-2-grid-geoparquet/raw/main/sentinel-2-grid.parquet'
      using driver `Parquet' successful.

## Is the Sentinel-2 grid a good solution for my use case?

I will not be able to answer this of course, and it depends on your specific use case.
However, I wanted to leave this [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.07.015) 
by Bauer-Marschallinger & Falkner (2023) here to advocate for alternative grid systems such
as the [Equi7 grid](https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid). With more and more Earth Observation
data being available, we as a community need to move forward and innovate in the way we access and
process this huge volume of data.
